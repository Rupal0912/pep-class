1.function is about process
2.class is about memory(either saving the memory or using it again and again) it is about like writing set of rules that will be followed by many things for which we will create objects , now class k andr:
    methods , data types
methods is inside class but func ka aesa kuch ni h
methods 2 type k:
class method: it will not be created again and again like objects it will be there inside class just ones , no access to object memory
instance method:it will  be created in every object again and again whenevr we need a new object with specific info, will have acces to class memory
class member: how to acces them ->> classname.membername
object member: how to access them ->> objectreference.member
python:1st parameter in each method insetead of this(self kuch ni hota)
A method that will be executed automatically under certain conditions are called constructors.
what should we write inside of constructor? whatever code we want to execute automatically whenever an object is created or all certain conditions
